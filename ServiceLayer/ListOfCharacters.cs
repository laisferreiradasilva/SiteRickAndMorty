In the episode 'Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind', one of Rick's happy memories of Morty was picking him up as a baby.

These traits make him the perfect sidekick to Rick.[3] He is interested in Jessica, a student in his math class. Like many boys his age, he spends a good deal of time masturbating.    Morty may sometimes act spineless, but he has shown bravery and quick-wittedness in the face of adversity, such as leading the extraction effort out of Anatomy Park, and using a pair of grappling boots to escape the guards in Intergalactic Customs.[2] Morty is also quite responsible for his age, refusing to kill an alien child in the episode 'Raising Gazorpazorp'.    While Rick, Beth, and Jerry have all expressed their belief that Morty is unintelligent, there is substantial evidence to the contrary. When the group at Anatomy Park are attacked by Gonorrhea, he comes up with the idea to exploit the gas building up in the body to defeat the disease. He is able to grasp complex concepts, such as the multiverse of infinite realities, when Rick explains them to him, and is quick to notice Rick's hypocrisy regarding the morality of his microverse in 'The Ricks Must Be Crazy.' His hidden intelligence also continues to be an asset in season 2. Impressively, Morty is able to distract Fart, a being capable of reading minds, by requesting that he sing. This gives Morty time to kill him with an antimatter gun, clearly surprising the telepathic being. In 'Total Rickall,' Morty is the first to realize that the alien parasites are only capable of creating positive memories. He was also able to, while inside the Teenyverse, find the Tree People, be accepted into their group, learn their language and culture, and work his way up the ranks until he had the ability to command them, all within, from their perspective according to Rick, a few months. Despite this, he thinks poorly of his own intelligence, referring to Jerry and himself as 'idiots' when Scroopy Noopers questions the intelligence of the members of the Smith Family in 'Something Ricked This Way Comes.' This is probably because of his impressionable nature; since Rick and his parents tell Morty he's stupid, and because he doesn't perform well in school, he has a low opinion of himself.    Despite his malleable nature, Morty has the strength to be able to stand up to Rick. In the episode 'Meeseeks and Destroy', Morty directly calls out Rick on his cynical nature. He leads his own adventure with the direct goal of helping villagers.[4] His malleable nature makes him echo Ricks words and speech, especially after Rick insults Summer, though he has a tendency to become hysterically upset at her.    Morty is shown to have repressed anger issues which is most notable seen in 'Look Who's Purging Now'. These anger issues have caused him to become hysterical and homicidal.    In the episode, 'Morty's Mind Blowers', when Morty remembers everything he asked Rick to remove from his mind, he tries to kill himself, and if it weren't for Summer walking in at that exact moment, he would've been dead.";

When the group at Anatomy Park are attacked by Gonorrhea, he comes up with the idea to exploit the gas building up in the body to defeat the disease. He is able to grasp complex concepts, such as the multiverse of infinite realities, when Rick explains them to him, and is quick to notice Rick's hypocrisy regarding the morality of his microverse in 'The Ricks Must Be Crazy.' His hidden intelligence also continues to be an asset in season 2. Impressively, Morty is able to distract Fart, a being capable of reading minds, by requesting that he sing. This gives Morty time to kill him with an antimatter gun, clearly surprising the telepathic being. In 'Total Rickall,' Morty is the first to realize that the alien parasites are only capable of creating positive memories. He was also able to, while inside the Teenyverse, find the Tree People, be accepted into their group, learn their language and culture, and work his way up the ranks until he had the ability to command them, all within, from their perspective according to Rick, a few months. Despite this, he thinks poorly of his own intelligence, referring to Jerry and himself as 'idiots' when Scroopy Noopers questions the intelligence of the members of the Smith Family in 'Something Ricked This Way Comes.' This is probably because of his impressionable nature; since Rick and his parents tell Morty he's stupid, and because he doesn't perform well in school, he has a low opinion of himself.    Despite his malleable nature, Morty has the strength to be able to stand up to Rick. In the episode 'Meeseeks and Destroy', Morty directly calls out Rick on his cynical nature. He leads his own adventure with the direct goal of helping villagers.[4] His malleable nature makes him echo Ricks words and speech, especially after Rick insults Summer, though he has a tendency to become hysterically upset at her.    Morty is shown to have repressed anger issues which is most notable seen in 'Look Who's Purging Now'. These anger issues have caused him to become hysterical and homicidal.    In the episode, 'Morty's Mind Blowers', when Morty remembers everything he asked Rick to remove from his mind, he tries to kill himself, and if it weren't for Summer walking in at that exact moment, he would've been dead.";
